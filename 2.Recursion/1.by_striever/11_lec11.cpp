// subset sum II 
// here you will have to print all the subset excluding the duplicate subset 

// [1,2,2,2,3,3]
// // first approach is find all the subset using pick and not pcik technique and then put them into the set and it will remove the dupclicate subset 
// 2^N------> set-------->list<list>
// so you are using the extra time in puting the set and then agian converting it 
// size of set mlogm
// where m=(2^N)

// so we have to optimise the recursin
